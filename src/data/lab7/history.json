The application of knowledge is more important than only knowledge itself. Otherwise, knowledge is like a lost treasure that has no value. The application can be multidimensional to achieve physical or intrinsic goals. We all use to hear Think-Big. Thinking big is important but thinking big can not bring success unless someone has very good knowledge and will-force to make it successful. Without these two qualities, only big thinking can put a person into bigger trouble than a bigger success. Needless to mention that vision is required to think big and knowledge is required to think deep. Though one of the articles in this book carries the same name as the book title but almost all articles are related to this thought which provokes and develop the deep thinking capability of a person. In this book, I have discussed many aspects of the qualities and knowledge one should have to perform well be he/she is in a job or an entrepreneur in the Sales and Marketing arena.

Covering Dutt\u2019s career in proscenium, street theatre and Jatra, it analyzes the interesting exchange of dramatic art with politics in his theatre. Owing to a plethora of unsubstantiated opinions, Dutt is either revered by his followers or dismissed by his opponents, but hardly ever studied with necessary objectivity and intellectual rigour. The book attempts to bust the myth that Dutt was primarily a political propagandist who used theatre only as a means to achieve his political end. The remarkable range of Dutt\u2019s subject matter makes him as internationally significant as he is loved by Indian theatre enthusiasts. His work has been discussed on various reputed international platforms. Yet there is a stark lacuna when it comes to intellectual attention devoted to Dutt\u2019s theatre. This is the first book which attempts to introduce Dutt\u2019s theatre comprehensively to an international readership. The book looks briefly at Dutt\u2019s life, the impact of his politics on his theatre, the art of his characterization, his dramaturgy and stage technique, and the legacy of his work in theatre. It also offers the reader with a chronological list of the first performances of his original theatrical works and an exhaustive bibliography, which, it is hoped, shall prove especially useful for researchers. The book is designed for lay theatre enthusiasts as well as advanced students of theatre.", "imageLinks": {"thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UurkEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=UurkEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA115&dq=Subrata&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api"}}, {"volumeInfo": {"title": "Subnational Movements In South Asia", "authors": ["Subrata Mitra", "R.
